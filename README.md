# Tarot Card Reading Game (with a little twist)

Discover your fate through a standard Major and Minor Arcana tarot card reading! Tarot decks contain 78 cards divided into two major groups:

1. 22 Major Arcana Cards
2. 56 Minor Arcana Cards

The 22 Major Arcana include cards such as The Fool or The World, while the 56 Minor Arcana hold cards like Queen of Wands and Eight of Swords. Essentially, the Major Arcana symbolizes larger events of life, whereas the Minor Arcana represents day-to-day insights.

## MVP Goals:
1. As a user, I will be presented a 79 card deck that is meant to be shuffled once clicked.
2. As a user, 10 cards will then randomly be generated.
3. As a user, these 10 cards will be placed faced down on the table in the structure of a Celtic Cross Card Spread tarot card reading.
4. As a user, I will click a button to reveal the cards face up.
5. As a user, the order of the cards will reveal the meaning of each cardâ€™s reading in its placement according to the structure in the interpretation section.
6. As a user, in order for me to "win" and get a good reading, I need to get 5 or more "positive" cards (which will be listed below). Conversely, if I get 5 or more "negative" cards, I "lose" and my reading is bad.
7. As a user, if I "win", the game will generate a message stating my positive reading. If I "lose", the game will generate a message stating my negative reading. 
 
## Stretch Goals:
1. As a user, I will be able to pick my 10 cards from deck instead of generated randomization.
2. As a user, I will be able to see a more detailed reading when hovering over card once revealed.
3. As a user, there will be a set timer for deck to be shuffled and I can see that shuffling in real-time.
4. As a user, there will be cards that sometimes randomly turn upside down to represent "cards reversed", which have a different interpretation.
